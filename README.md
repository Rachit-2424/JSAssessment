# smart-contract--using-solidity


This is a Solidity smart contract that demonstrates the usage of require, assert, and revert statements for error handling and control flow in Ethereum blockchain applications.
To compile and deploy this smart contract, you need the following:

Solidity compiler version 0.8.0 or compatible
Ethereum development environment

A smart contract is a self-executing agreement implemented on a blockchain platform, typically using a programming language called Solidity. Solidity is a high-level language designed specifically for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, although it can also be used on other blockchain platforms.
